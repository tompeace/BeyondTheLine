    <p>Want to get involved? Thanks! There are plenty of ways to help!</p>
    
    <h2 id="reporting-issues">Reporting issues</h2>
    
    <p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in the
    repository.</p>
    
    <p>Please read the following guidelines before you <a href="https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit/issues/">report an issue</a>:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Use the GitHub issue search</strong> — check if the issue has already been
    reported. If it has been, please comment on the existing issue.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong> — the latest <code>master</code> or
    development branch may already contain a fix.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Isolate the demonstrable problem</strong> — make sure that the code in the
    project's repository is <em>definitely</em> responsible for the issue. Create a
    <a href="http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/">reduced test case</a> - an
    extremely simple and immediately viewable example of the issue.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Include a live example</strong> — provide a link to your reduced test case
    when appropriate (e.g. if the issue is related to (front-end technologies).
    Please use <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsFiddle</a> to host examples.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report too. What is your
    environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
    experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
    details will help people to assess and fix any potential bugs.</p>
    
    <h3 id="example-of-a-good-bug-report">Example of a good bug report:</h3>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>Short and descriptive title</p>
    
      <p>A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
    suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>This is the first step</li>
        <li>This is the second step</li>
        <li>Further steps, etc.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p><code>&lt;url&gt;</code> (a link to the reduced test case)</p>
    
      <p>Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
    reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
    causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
    merits).</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A good bug report shouldn't leave people needing to chase you up to get further
    information that is required to assess or fix the bug.</p>

    <h2 id="responding-to-issues">Responding to issues</h2>
    
    <p>Feel free to respond to other people's issues! Some people may be reporting 
    issues that can easily be solved even without modification to the project's 
    code.</p>
    
    <p>You can also help by verifying issues reported.</p>

    <h2 id="the-help-wanted-tag">The 'help wanted' tag</h2>
    
    <p>Some <a href="https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit/issues/">issues</a> are tagged with the 'help wanted' tag. These issues often:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>are missing an actual implementation, or</li>
      <li>need people's help in verifying and replicating the issue, or</li>
      <li>need test cases.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you would like to contribute code and don't have any specific issue you want 
    to fix, this would be a good place to start looking at!</p>

    <h2 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h2>
    
    <p>Good pull requests — patches, improvements, new features — are a fantastic
    help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
    commits.</p>
    
    <p>If your contribution involves a significant amount of work or substantial
    changes to any part of the project, please open an issue to discuss it first.</p>
    
    <p>Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the
    project:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> the project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Clone your fork (<code>git clone
    https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/html5-boilerplate.git</code>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add an <code>upstream</code> remote (<code>git remote add upstream
    https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit.git</code>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>Get the latest changes from upstream (e.g. `git pull upstream
        <dev-branch>`).
    
    </dev-branch>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix (<code>git
    checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;</code>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure that your changes adhere to the current coding conventions used
    throughout the project - indentation, accurate comments, etc. Please update
    any documentation that is relevant to the change you are making.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Commit your changes in logical chunks; use git's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">interactive
    rebase</a> feature to tidy
    up your commits before making them public. Please adhere to these <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">git commit
    message
    guidelines</a>
    or your pull request is unlikely be merged into the main project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream branch into your topic branch.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Push your topic branch up to your fork (`git push origin
        <topic-branch-name>`).
    
    </topic-branch-name>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">Open a Pull Request</a> with a
    clear title and description. Please mention which browsers you tested in.</li>
